# snapd-angular

This is a 'private' repo, in that I'm using it as a way to backup code but not with the intention of sharing it just yet. It's also currently incomplete, so any attempt to run the code will result in errors.

TODO

- zoom/pan full size image
- thumbnail pagination
- notes on photos
- sort out loading animation (diff icon?)

- better design
